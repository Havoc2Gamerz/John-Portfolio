    <p> After high school, I plan to go to college for computer science. I will first go to community college and transfer to a four-year college to get my bachelors. 
      After I get my bachelors in computer science, I hope to get work toward my career job. I became interested in programming when I first saw my uncle work on his coding project for work. 
      I saw that with code, one  can create many cool things and sources for people to use. I also researched programming as a career and thought that the working environment and programming was really fun and a great job all around.</p>
